# Final Project: IoT System Design and Machine Learning Insights

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a Machine Learning IoT Application as part of the Final Team Project for the course AAI 530. The project leverages a real-world IoT dataset to create a theoretical IoT system design, process and analyze sensor data, and provide machine learning insights. Results are presented in a Tableau Public Dashboard with actionable visualizations.

## Objectives
1. **IoT System Design**:
   - Create a diagram with technical specifications for sensors, edge devices, networking, and data storage.
   - Document each componentâ€™s role and limitations.

2. **Machine Learning**:
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing.
   - Implement **two machine learning models**:
     - A **deep learning model** built from scratch using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
     - A **time-series prediction model** to generate future insights from IoT data.

3. **Dashboard Visualization**:
   - Create an interactive **Tableau Public Dashboard** with:
     - At least one **status visualization** showing real-time device insights.
     - At least one **summary visualization** of historical data.
     - Visualizations for the insights generated by the two machine learning models.
